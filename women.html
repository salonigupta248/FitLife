                You are definitely not alone, if you are in two minds about starting therapy. Popular culture idea of therapy is a couch, talking about childhood, daddy & mommy issues. While this is scarcely true, it is also so deeply entrenched that it makes people nervous about starting therapy. And then there is all this overwhelming psychobabble around it that leaves too many questions unanswered.

These professionals go through rigorous training to be able to handle the entire spectrum of mental wellness from severe psychiatric illnesses to day-to-day mental wellness.<br>
What you need depends on the problems that you are grappling with and the kind of guidance that you are looking for!<br>

                There is a time and place for every type of help. Context is everything. Example – a life coach cannot treat schizophrenia or severe addiction. Sometimes, you might need a combination of professionals. Even common cases like depression and anxiety sometimes require intervention both from psychiatrists and psychologists. Moreover, it is important to educate oneself to not fall prey to charlatans masquerading around as legit professionals. Digitization and lack of a licensing framework has made it super easy for just about anyone to set up a shop. Be wary of such experts. It is important to see a credible professional

                <p class="card-text">
                   <b> Invest in relationships – </b> Keep your loved ones close, nurture a support system for yourself. It could mean not missing birthdays or being there for others when they are down and out. More the number of meaningful relationships in your life, less likely you are to be depressed <br>

                <b>Give, share and be kind – </b>Kindness and generosity activate circuits in your brain that lead to mood enhancement and contentment. It is in giving that we find the deepest joy that exists<br>

                <b>Have a goal – </b> A sense of purpose serves as an anchor for the boat of life. Being driven in direction rather than aimlessly drifting makes you less susceptible to depression<br>

                <b>Exercise – </b>There is not a list that exists where exercise does not figure as a recommendation. This one is no different. The science of endorphins is real.<br>

                <b>Routine – </b>Having a daily routine leaves little room for the mind to wander and a disciplined mind is less likely to fall prey to the tentacles of depression.<br>

                <b>Meditate – </b>Yes, same old advice but supremely effective. There is enough and more research that shows that meditation over a period of time can alter brain chemistry for the better.<br>

                <p class="card-text">
                   <b> Stand up for yourself – </b>No one else will defend you in the court of life. World is not entirely just, and fair. And lot of times you will have the short end of the stick.<br>

                    <b>Do not let the pitiless inner critic overwhelm you – </b> Measured self-criticism can help us do better. But when it is relentless and scathing, it kills the last ounce of self-esteem left. <br>

                    <b>Surround yourself with positive people – </b>Choose people in your life wisely. They shape your life experience. Do not put up with bullies and psychopaths.<br>

                    <b>Find time to do things that bring you joy – </b>Pursuing things for the sheer joy of it is not a luxury, but a necessity to live a gratifying life.<br>

                    <b>Take care of your body and mind – </b>You are your body and mind. Its up-keep is crucial to your wellbeing. Ignoring the needs of your physical body and your mind is bound to cause damage to you.<br>

                    <b>Forgive yourself – </b>You are bigger than your mistakes. Show yourself the compassion that you would show to a loved one. It is human to err. <br>

                    <b>Live intentionally – </b>Anchoring yourself to a purpose is the highest form of self-love. Humans seek meaning and find happiness through meaning. And it is non-negotiable to have a positive sense of self.<br>

                    Communication is the key. If you feel there are some inhibitions and some hesitancy on both of your sides to communicate openly, your partner can seek outside help and therapy. If they are a little hesitant to try therapy, do not try to push your opinion on them. It is a big step and rejecting therapy at first is an instinct for many. However, take time and effort to talk to your partner about it and help them understand how it can help both of you in the long run. You can find therapists for them, however, do not simply book an appointment for them. Let them take the first step toward their mental well-being.

                    You and your partner can also seek couple’s therapy. This will help both of you create an open communication channel between the two of you and sustain it for long. A therapist can help you both understand the partner’s anxiety better and live with it productively. It is important to remember while treating anxiety disorders, the goal is not to get rid of them completely but learn to live with them. Then gradually a person can cultivate habits and learn to manage the symptoms of anxiety better. Hence, therapy can be immensely helpful in such situations.

                    One of the most effective ways of relieving anxiety and coping with the stress you experience every day is making crucial lifestyle changes. Natural remedies for treating anxiety generally entail taking care of your own body, eliminating unhealthy habits, and participating in different healthy activities. Major lifestyle changes that can help you do away with anxiety to a considerable extent are:
<br>
                    Meditating<br>
                    
                    Getting sufficient sleep<br>
                    
                    Staying active<br>
                    
                    Working out regularly<br>
                    
                    Eating a balanced and healthy diet<br>
                    
                    Avoiding alcohol and caffeine<br>
                    
                    Quitting smoking<br>
                    <br>
                    Talk therapy, medicines, and lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and enough sleep, can help eliminate anxiety. But research suggests that certain foods can also benefit your brain if you are experiencing anxiety frequently. These foods are:
                    <br>
                    Dark chocolate
                    <br>
                    Salmon
                    <br>
                    Turmeric
                    <br>
                    Chamomile
                    <br>
                    Green tea
                    <br>

                    Managing BPD can be challenging. The very first step is to identify the triggers. Since you might be triggered by something that some other individual with BPD might not be triggered with, it can be challenging to determine your triggers until you identify the events, thoughts, situations, and feelings that set off your BPD symptoms. And once you place them, start avoiding them by practising different coping skills like:
<br>
<b>Playing Music</b>
<br>
Playing music that creates an emotion opposite to what you are experiencing can help manage BPD triggers.
<br>
<b>Engage in Some Form of Activity</b>
<br>
Engaging in some form of activity like dancing, walking, or cleaning the house can distract you from the emotion you are going through.
<br>
<b>Find Proper Support</b>
<br>
Getting help from other individuals while struggling with your strong emotions can be helpful. 
<br>
<b>Be Mindful</b>
<br>
Identify the emotion you are experiencing and allow yourself to share it in the form of a wave instead of blocking or suppressing it or holding on to it.
<br>
<b>Ground Yourself</b>
<br>
When you are zoned out, start doing something to ground yourself. For example, hold an ice cube in your hand for some time.

                    The process of therapy is a beautiful one and by beautiful, I mean a wholesome one. It involves a therapist who is a trained mental health professional with experience in how to help people best with their skills. Mental health is an important aspect of one’s life and that realisation time varies from person to person. While some go ahead with it to walk on a mentally healthier path, others feel stuck or restricted due to multiple reasons, stigma being one of them. The main purpose of psychotherapy is to create a safe environment for people to be vulnerable with themselves and their own feelings. Oftentimes, therapy sessions help people understand what it is that they truly think and feel and this can be considered a huge revelation. 
                    <br>
                    One of the most important concepts that CBT breaks is the difference between thoughts and facts. Sometimes, thoughts are so strong that clients start considering them to be facts but with CBT, they realise that thoughts can be irrational and can be worked upon. Under these major steps come the factors of control, problem solving, decision making, task breakdown and much more. All in all, CBT as a psychotherapy is a rich experience for the client and a fulfilling experience for a therapist.
